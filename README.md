# Sport Trivia

This is a basic TS React app. It's been a little while since I created an app, and it's high time I sharpen my skills again.

# Goals
1. Sharpen pre-existing app-building skills
2. Gain confidence with TS basics
3. Employ some external backend base (likely PocketBase)
4. Make an app I will want to use, and set it up so I can easily expand to more quizzes using as much DRY, reusable code as I can.
